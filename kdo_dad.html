    <h1> Ten ideas of gift for Father's day</h1>
    <h2>Motorcycle jacket</h2>
    <p>Every day we see him proudly riding his trusty mechanical steed. As children, we had stars in our eyes, seeing our father as a road warrior. Today, things have changed for one reason: the state of his equipment. Punctured gloves, boot soles as smooth as Dinara Kasko's cake, but above all, a jacket that seems to have been through the war. In the world of motorized two-wheelers, Helston's is one of the most famous brands. In fact, in addition to equipping its products with excellent protection, it makes a point of honour of making parts with a worked style. Among its collection, there is a jacket that caught our eye: the Genesis. Its outer fabric, similar to raw denim, is a blend of cotton (50%), polyester (30%) and cordura, renowned for its strength. With a multitude of pockets, it also has a removable under-jacket as well as a back and shoulder and elbow protectors. A summer motorcycle jacket that combines style and safety, perfect for a two-wheeled ride with the setting sun as a backdrop.

    <h2>Original wallet</h2>
    <p>As far back as our memories go, we've always seen him with this big, bulky leather wallet that deforms the back pockets of all his jeans. If our father is so proud of it, it's because "it didn't cost much and lasted 30 years! ». But when you look at the piece, its broken seams, torn zipper and faded, crumpled leather suggest that it's high time for this famous wallet to take a well-deserved retirement. Why not replace this antique with a brand new wallet? Compact and practical, it allows you to carry just the right amount of change with you. With its original triangular shape, its full grain Italian vegetable-tanned leather (available in two colours, camel and black) and its small size, this Victor (that's its name) will find its place in any outing of the everyday life: drink with friends, market, last minute shopping, etc...</p>
    <h2>A shirt</h2>
    <p>What if Father's Day was a chance to make our daddy a little more elegant? For that, what better than the major piece of any self-respecting man's wardrobe, the white shirt? A true timeless piece of our wardrobe, it dresses up in the blink of an eye and can be worn on any occasion. For fifty years, FIGARET Paris has been striving to make quality shirts. Fabric, assembly and details, nothing is left to chance in order to offer the best possible piece. In a nod to its founder, the brand has just released a brand new model, the Alain, via a capsule. The latter has two different finishes: the first one features the famous Figaret collar and musketeer cuffs, while the other opts for a similar straight collar and simple cuffs. Both have a Tunisian type buttonhole. A beautiful piece, which will magnify the silhouette of dad (and made in twill Giza 87 what's more!).</p>
    <h2>A beautiful tie</h2>
    <p>An accessory inseparable from a formal wardrobe, the tie is a more complex piece than it seems. In fact, it is governed by several implicit laws that you must know if you want to wear it at its best. Clearly, if it is well chosen, a tie will complete an outfit. Evolving in the world of shirts, Charles Tyrwhitt also offers all sorts of accessories around this iconic piece. Mainly in silk, the English brand also makes them in linen, cotton, or a mix. Offering a wide choice of colors and patterns, it seems difficult not to find a model that will please!</p>
